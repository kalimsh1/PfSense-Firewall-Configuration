The process of setting up pfSense in VMware with a Windows device as the client involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to assist in the configuration, with references to the provided images where applicable. Each step is designed to ensure a thorough and accurate setup for documentation purposes on GitHub.

1. **Download pfSense Software**: Obtain the latest stable version of pfSense from the official website. Navigate to the pfSense download page and select the appropriate version (e.g., 2.7.2-RELEASE).

2. **Install VMware Workstation**: Ensure VMware Workstation Pro (e.g., version 17) is installed on the Windows host machine. Launch the application and create a new virtual machine.

3. **Create a New Virtual Machine**: Open the New Virtual Machine Wizard in VMware. Specify the virtual machine name (e.g., "pfSense-FW2") and select the location for the virtual machine files (e.g., C:\Users\AdminOneDrive\Documents\Virtual Machines\pfSense-FW2).

5. **Mount the pfSense ISO**: Attach the downloaded pfSense ISO file to the virtual machineâ€™s CD/DVD (IDE) drive. Ensure the device status is set to "Connected" and "Connect at power on" is checked.

6. **Power On the Virtual Machine**: Start the virtual machine to begin the pfSense installation process. Monitor the boot-up sequence and installation details.
